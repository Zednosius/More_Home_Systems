 pc_mhs_durin_desert:0 "Desert World"
 pc_mhs_durin_desert_desc:0 "Dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Precipitation and major bodies of surface water are relatively rare. Significant temperature variations between day and night cycles. Vegetation is scarce, but even moderate precipitation can make the desert bloom."
 pc_mhs_durin_arid:0 "Arid World"
 pc_mhs_durin_arid_desc:0 "Dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The dust-covered terrain consists largely of mesas and canyons. Forests can be found in the more temperate polar regions, but vegetation is otherwise scarce."
 pc_mhs_durin_tundra:0 "Tundra World"
 pc_mhs_durin_tundra_desc:0 "Cold and rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Permafrost covers most of the surface except for the more temperate equatorial regions. A stable biosphere exists but vegetation is mostly limited to mosses and lichens."
 pc_mhs_durin_continental:0 "Continental World"
 pc_mhs_durin_continental_desc:0 "Rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Active and stable hydrosphere. Great landmasses are separated by oceans, with large climate variations depending on latitude and precipitation."
 pc_mhs_durin_tropical:0 "Tropical World"
 pc_mhs_durin_tropical_desc:0 "Humid, rocky world with a thick nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Seasons with significant precipitation are interchanged with drier periods. Most landmasses are covered in dense vegetation."
 pc_mhs_durin_ocean:0 "Ocean World"
 pc_mhs_durin_ocean_desc:0 "Rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a significant hydrosphere. Oceans cover more than §Y90%§! of the surface, with scattered islands making up the remaining percentage."
 pc_mhs_durin_arctic:0 "Arctic World"
 pc_mhs_durin_arctic_desc:0 "Frigid, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The poles are big, and significant water deposits can be found permanently frozen as glacial ice. However, the planet experiences seasonal variations and the equatorial band is covered by vegetation."
 pc_mhs_durin_alpine:0 "Alpine World"
 pc_mhs_durin_alpine_desc:0 "Mountainous world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Snow covers the mountaintops and frozen-over lakes dot the valleys. While the planet experiences minimal seasonal variations, the still-liquid water beneath the frozen surface of the lakes is enough to sustain some hardy vegetation."
 pc_mhs_durin_savannah:0 "Savanna World"
 pc_mhs_durin_savannah_desc:0 "Rocky world dominated by dry, arid plains covered by a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The small hydrosphere allows for brief wet seasons, but aside from a few ubiquitous grasses vegetation is largely concentrated around shallow oases."
 pc_mhs_durin_gaia:0 "Gaia World"
 pc_mhs_durin_gaia_desc:0 "An ideal, temperate world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a resilient ecosystem. Optimal conditions for all known higher forms of life at different latitudes."
 
 pc_mhs_durin_continental_tile:0 "Temperate Terrain"
 pc_mhs_durin_continental_tile_desc:0 "Diverse forested terrain with a mild climate."
 pc_mhs_durin_desert_tile:0 "Desert Terrain"
 pc_mhs_durin_desert_tile_desc:0 "Barren and dry terrain with occasional rocky outcroppings."
 pc_mhs_durin_arid_tile:0 "Arid Terrain"
 pc_mhs_durin_arid_tile_desc:0 "Dry and rocky terrain with sparse vegetation."
 pc_mhs_durin_tundra_tile:0 "Tundra Terrain"
 pc_mhs_durin_tundra_tile_desc:0 "Cold and wind-swept steppes with sparse vegetation."
 pc_mhs_durin_tropical_tile:0 "Tropical Terrain"
 pc_mhs_durin_tropical_tile_desc:0 "Vegetation-covered terrain with a warm and humid climate."
 pc_mhs_durin_ocean_tile:0 "Ocean Terrain"
 pc_mhs_durin_ocean_tile_desc:0 "Isolated islands and archipelagos surrounded by ocean."
 pc_mhs_durin_arctic_tile:0 "Arctic Terrain"
 pc_mhs_durin_arctic_tile_desc:0 "Snow- and ice-covered terrain with no vegetation."
 pc_mhs_durin_savannah_tile:0 "Savanna Terrain"
 pc_mhs_durin_savannah_tile_desc:0 "Warm, dry terrain with widely spaced trees and shrubs."
 pc_mhs_durin_alpine_tile:0 "Alpine Terrain"
 pc_mhs_durin_alpine_tile_desc:0 "Elevated terrain covered in snow and ice."
 pc_mhs_durin_gaia_tile:0 "Gaia Terrain"
 pc_mhs_durin_gaia_tile_desc:0 "Diverse terrain with biomes that are eminently suitable to most forms of life."
 pc_mhs_durin_nuked_colonize_tile:0 "Wasteland Terrain"
 pc_mhs_durin_nuked_colonize_tile_desc:0 "Harsh, war-torn terrain. Radiation levels are low enough to support some life."
 
 planetary_ring_nuked_tile:0 "Ring World Terrain"
 planetary_ring_nuked_tile_desc:0 "Pristine terrain carefully maintained by the Ring World's internal systems."

 pc_mhs_nuked:0 "Tomb World"
 pc_mhs_nuked_desc:0 "A rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. It is currently experiencing a nuclear winter, with dense layers of sooty aerosols in the atmosphere. High levels of surface radiation."
 pc_mhs_nuked_tile:0 "Wasteland Terrain"
 pc_mhs_nuked_tile_desc:0 "Harsh, war-torn terrain. Radiation levels are low enough to support some life."
 pc_mhs_nuked_by_asteroids_tile:0 "Tundra Terrain"
 pc_mhs_nuked_by_asteroids_tile_desc:0 "Cold and wind-swept steppes with sparse vegetation."
